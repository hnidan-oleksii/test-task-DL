B-MOUNTAIN I-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	Mount Mazama is a destroyed stratovolcano in the Oregon part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range located in the United States .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	The volcano's collapsed caldera holds Crater Lake , and the entire mountain is located within Crater Lake National Park . Mazama was destroyed by a volcanic eruption that occurred around 5677 ( 150 ) BC .
O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O	The eruption reduced Mazama's approximate height by around a mile ( 1600 m ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O	At 8159 feet ( 2487 m ) , Hillman Peak is now the highest point on the rim . The Klamath Native Americans of the area believed that the mountain was inhabited by Llao , their god of the underworld .
O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	After the mountain destroyed itself the Klamaths recounted the events as a great battle between Llao and his rival Skell , their sky god .
O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	" Mazama started to grow around 400000 years ago in the Pleistocene , mainly from lava flows interbedded with some pyroclastic material .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O	More explosive eruptions started around 75000 years ago and built a westward trending line of composite cones . Cone building eruptions lasted until around 50000 years ago when andesite lava flowed down Mazama's north and southwest slopes .
O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	Consequently , Mazama's base was broader and its sides not as steep as today's Mount Shasta . After its cone building phase , Mazama lavas became increasingly silica rich and viscous two conditions that tend to trap explosive gases .
O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	The first major eruption in this new cycle of Mazama's life occurred about 10000 years later , when dacite flows high on the volcano's southwest face formed a series of domes .
O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O	The mountain started to sag under its own weight .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O	The collapse and the erosive ring eruptions fed each otherthe sinking volcano pushed magma upward and the erupting material both lubricated the downward subsidence and eroded the sides , making it easier for much of Mazama to sink into the earth .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O	Notable among these are Kerr Notch , Munson Valley , and Sun Notch . The last pyroclastic flow of this stage was andesitic scoria , indicating that Mazama was drawing on material deep from within its magma chamber .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O	The magma was replaced by about the same volume of material when most of Mazama fell into its caldera .
O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O	At that time , Mazama was about shorter than its initial height of approximately .
O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	One pyroclastic flow traveled from Mazama down Rogue River Valley while another moved north in between Mount Bailey and Mount Thielsen , moving over Diamond Lake ( it finally came to rest in North Umpqua River valley ) .
O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	As with all tephra layers , Mazama ash is thickest near its source ( ) and becomes thinner with increasing distance from its source .
O O O O O O O O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	northwest it is thick . Deposits of pyroclastic flow material near Mazama remained extremely hot for months , and in some places they were more than deep .
O O O O B-MOUNTAIN O O O O O O O O O	All volcanic activity on Mazama since its collapse has been within the caldera .
